Game by Daniel Benmergui

Dragonsweeper is an exciting twist on the classic Minesweeper game, crafted by the talented game designer Daniel Benmergui. Instead of sweeping for mines, players embark on a thrilling quest where they use logic and strategy to locate hidden dragons across the game board.

This unique reimagining combines familiar Minesweeper mechanics with an engaging dragon theme. As Jorge the brave knight, you'll use your keen observation skills and tactical thinking to navigate through dragon territories. Each number represents the combined power of nearby dragons, adding an extra layer of strategy to the classic gameplay.
